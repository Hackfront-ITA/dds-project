# Accountable Byzantine Consensus
Project for Dependable Distributed Systems course

### Project description
The goal of the project is to implement an accountable consensus primitive based on this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2023.104743) ([archived](./docs/paper.pdf)).
There are no constraints on the programming language or libraries to be used, nor on the environment (local machine, docker, cloud free tiers, simulator).
Part of the project is to perform a dependability evaluation (both from a functionality and performance point of view).
Crash failures must be considered, whereas some Byzantine misbehaviours could be
considered in the evaluation.
